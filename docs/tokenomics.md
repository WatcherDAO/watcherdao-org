The WatcherDAO token holds no inherent value. It will launch with the sole use case of being used for governance.

There will be a total supply of 7,000,000 million WatcherDAO tokens with the following distribution:

* **Community treasury:** 70% that is allocated across initial airdrop distribution, media mining program, and community treasury
  * Past WatcherDAO readers from the last 4 years (more detail to come): 3%
  * WathcerDAO Discord group airdrop: 3%
  * Media Mining: 15%
  * Community incentives (partner airdrops, social media campaigns, community writing bounties): 49%
* **Team (current and future):** 20% to current team and advisors, and another 10% that is allocated to future team

## Token Vesting Schedule

40% of the total token supply is available starting today, with the remaining tokens 60% unlocked after one year, and vested for a period of 3 years in line with the schedule below.

* **Year 0:** 40% of the tokens vested or 4 million tokens
* **Year 1:** 30% of the treasury tokens vested or 3 million tokens
* **Year 2:** 20% of the treasury tokens vested or 2 million tokens
* **Year 3:** 10% of the treasury tokens vested or 1 million tokens

#### Community Treasury

70% of all WatcherDAO tokens have been allocated to a community treasury. The community treasury is held in a multi-sig to be distributed at the community’s choosing. The above token vesting schedule applies to the community treasury. Treasury tokens are used at the discretion of the community, and may be allocated to any and all programs that add value to the ecosystem.

### Team and Advisor Allocation

30% of the total WatcherDAO supply will be allocated to Watcher Labs LLC. (the company that builds WatcherDAO) and its advisors. These tokens will be vested linearly over a period of 4 years on the same schedule as the community treasury.

* **Governance:** The main purpose of WATCH is to be used to govern our entire ecosystem including the publishing platform, treasury, and operations. Watcher Labs will over time hand over all control and management to the community. There will be community assigned editors and administrators. In the meanwhile, the token will be used to subsidize and form community bounties for the writers.
* **Liquidity:** Users can add liquidity to the WATCH / SOL Raydium pool and stake those to earn yield.
* **Access** Holders of WATCH can access our exclusive WATCH community events in Discord- including the most up-to-date research and analysis in the group, founder access, and ongoing direct deal flow.
* **HODL:** Starting soon, WatcherDAO holders will have an opportunity to earn from the community rewards pool. The ability to claim will be dependent on the amount of on-chain actions they take within our ecosystem.
