# Entity Lists

The core innovation with WatcherDAO is its ability to verify and scale read operations on the Solana blockchain. It is common knowledge to any developer who has ever spent time working on Solana that since the blockchain is optimized for write operations, consistently performing and aggregating read operations is no simple task.

WatcherDAO's [Entity Lists](https://www.entitylists.org) standard improves on Uniswap's Ethereum [Token Lists](https://tokenlists.org/). Entity Lists remove gatekeeping while decoupling discovery and reputation for the Solana community.
